<b>Yoink</b><br>
<p>Yoink is an iMessage App that can be sent in a group chat. Members of the group can enter their preferences for a restaurant (proximity, cuisine, price). The application keeps track of who has responded, and members of the group can request a recommendation at any time. At that point, the algorithm makes a recommendation for a restaurant that weights each person's criteria equally (relative to each person) and finds a restaurant that closely matches an 'average' combination of each person's criteria.</p><br>
